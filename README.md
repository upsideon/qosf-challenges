## Submission Process

Challenges completed prior to the submission deadline that I'd like to submit to the main repository are transferred to the [submissions](https://github.com/upsideon/qosf-challenges/tree/submissions) branch and a pull request is opened based off that branch. This structure allows the [main](https://github.com/upsideon/qosf-challenges/tree/main) branch of this fork to only contain my solutions to the challenges I've completed, while continuing to facilitate submission of solutions to the original repository.
